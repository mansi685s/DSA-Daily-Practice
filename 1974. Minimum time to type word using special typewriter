/*Problem -1974.Minimum time to type word using special type of typewriter
Platform-Leetcode
Difficulty-easy

Approach(Greedy approach)-
 Each character is iterated in string while finding the difference between start letter and letter written absolute value because of circular typewritter.
 Time taken is calculated by finding the minimum time to cover from which direction left(diff) and right(26-diff).
 start character is changed to the current character written.
 1 second is always added to during time calculation due to traversing each letter takes 1 sec and writting it 1 sec.
*/
//Solution-

class Solution {
    public int minTimeToType(String word) {
        int sum=0;
        char start='a';
        for(int i=0;word.length()>i;i++){
            char ch=word.charAt(i);
            int diff=Math.abs(ch-start);
            sum+=Math.min(diff,26-diff)+1;
            start=ch;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
